# PROBLEMS
1. Somehow got a whole tree root age that is less than the origin age of the island radiation for one of the simulations with a really young tree (3.61945 & 5.30684)
2. PhyloJunction repeatedly prints the epoch_idx
3. It takes a REALLY long time for pj to make trees

# notes for Sarah

What model parameters should we simulate under?

# unconstrained exponential
rho_w ~ dnExp(1.0/0.50)  # E[rho_w] = 0.50
rho_e ~ dnExp(1.0/0.25)  # E[rho_e] = 0.25

# constrained relationship
rho_w ~ dnExp(1.0/0.50)
rho_e_frac ~ dnUnif(0,1)
rho_e := rho_w * rho_e_frac

# unconstrained gamma
rho_w ~ dnGamma(8,16)  # E[rho_w] = 0.50
rho_e ~ dnGamma(4,16)  # E[rho_e] = 0.25
