Running PhyloJunction script
Matplotlib created a temporary cache directory at /tmp/790552.tmpdir/matplotlib-qci2nk77 because the default path (/home/k.swiston/.config/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
